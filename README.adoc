== Getting started

We needed a docker image that included hugo, asciidoctor so I created one.

Here is a helper script to build the same docker image and then to run the image to see if it's configured correctly.

== Commands

`build-docker.sh`:: Create a docker image

`run-docker.sh`:: runs a docker container that expects a `hugo` directory, the container name is `cm-hugo`
